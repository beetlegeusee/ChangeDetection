# ChangeDetection
basic east-to-understand change detection code using Tenserflow and OpenCV

ovwe here in my code, i realized i had downgraded my Tenserflow for some other project and now it wasnt sufficiently compatible with the recognition "coco" file. in order for that to work, pleas keep the latest tenserflow model instead. 
i will try doing that myself someday (hopefully), so that the notebook looks clean, but till then, here you go!
